<p>In this tutorial we're going to write a real web-application using vert.x.</p>
<p>The application is a shop application called "vToons" which allows you to buy tracks online.</p>
<h2 id="step-0-install-vertx">Step 0. Install vert.x</h2><br/>
<p>If you haven't yet installed vert.x, do that now. Installation instructions are here.</p>
<p>The rest of the tutorial will assume you have installed vert.x in directory <code>VERTX_HOME</code>.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-create-a-web-server">Step 1. Create a Web Server</h2><br/>
<p>Open a console, and create a new, empty directory. <code>cd</code> into it.</p>
<p>The first thing we're going to need is a web server, so let's write one.</p>
<p>Open a text editor and copy the following into it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">load('vertx.js');

var server = new vertx.HttpServer();

server.requestHandler(function(req) {
  if (req.path === '/') {
    req.response.sendFile('web/index.html');
  } else if (req.path.indexOf('..') === -1) {
    req.response.sendFile('web' + req.path);
  } else {
    req.response.statusCode = 404;
    req.response.end;
  }
}).listen(8080, 'localhost');

function vertxStop() {
  server.close();
}
</pre>
<p>We're creating an instance of <code>HttpServer</code> and we're setting a request handler function on it. The request handler gets called every time an HTTP request arrives on the server.</p>
<p>If the request is for the root, we just serve <code>index.html</code>. Otherwise we serve a file from the <code>web</code> directory corresponding to the path requested.</p>
<p>If the path url contains the string <code>..</code> we just return a 404. This is to prevent someone reading files outside of the <code>web</code> directory.  <br/>
</p>
<p>Save it as <code>web-server.js</code>.</p>
<p>Now, create a directory called web with a file <code>index.html</code> in it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">tim@Ethel:~/tutorial$ mkdir web
tim@Ethel:~/tutorial$ echo "&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" &gt; web/index.html
</pre>
<p>And run the web server:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">tim@Ethel:~/tutorial$ vertx run web_server.js
</pre>
<p>Point your browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You should see a page returned with 'Hello World'.  <br/>
</p>
<p>That's the web server done.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-serve-the-client-side-app">Step 2. Serve the client-side app</h2><br/>
<p>Now we have a working web server, we need to serve the actual client side app.</p>
<p>For this demo, we've written it using knockout.js and Twitter bootstrap, but in your apps you can use whatever client side toolset you feel most comfortable with.</p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is not to show you how knockout.js or Twitter bootstrap works so we won't delve into the client app in much detail.</p>
<p>Copy the client side application from the vert.x installation into our web directory as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">tim@Ethel:~/tutorial$ cp -r $VERTX_HOME/examples/demo/web/* web
</pre>
<p>Now, refresh your browser. The client application should now be served.</p>
<p>Of course, it won't do anything useful yet, since we haven't connected it up to anything, but you should at least see the layout. It should look like this: </p>
<p><img alt="Client Application" src="tutorial_1.png"/></p>
<p>Take some time to click around the app. It's pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>In the centre there's a set of tabs which let you flick between the shop, and your cart.</p>
<p>On the left hand bar there's a form which allows you to login.  <br/>
</p>
<h3 id="step-3-get-the-persistor-up-and-running">Step 3. Get the Persistor up and running</h3><br/>
<p>Vert.x ships with an out of the box bus module (busmod) called <code>MongoPersistor</code>. This is a busmod is component which communicates with other components on the vert.x event bus by exchanging JSON messages.</p>
<p>The <code>MongoPersistor</code> busmod allows you to store/update/delete/find data in a MongoDB database. (For detailed info on it, please see the busmods manual).</p>
<p>We're going to use a persistor in our application for a few different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing the catalogue of track data.</li>
<li>Storing usernames and passwords of users</li>
<li>Storing orders</li>
</ul>
<p>You could start a persistor on the command line by calling <code>vertx run busmods/mongo_persistor.js</code> but we're going to need to start several components to form our application, so it makes sense to create a controlling verticle (A verticle is just the name we give to any vert.x component) that starts up all the other components for us.</p>
<p>It can also contain the JSON configuration for our application. All verticles can be configured using JSON.</p>
<p>Open a text editor and copy in the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">load('vertx.js');

// Our application config

var app_conf = {
  persistor_conf: {
    address: 'demo.persistor',
    db_name: 'test_db'
  }
}

// Deploy the busmods

vertx.deployWorkerVerticle('busmods/mongo_persistor.js', app_conf.persistor_conf);

// Start the web server

vertx.deployVerticle('web_server.js');
</pre>
<p>Save it as <code>app.js</code>.</p>
<p>The calls to <code>vertx.deployVerticle</code> and <code>vertx.deployWorkerVerticle</code> are a programmatic way of starting other verticles from inside the code of a verticle.</p>
<p>As you can see, the persistor needs some configuration and that is passed in when we deploy the persistor verticle. The configuration is expressed in JSON.</p>
<p>The persistor needs two pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The address that it will listen to on the event bus for incoming messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course you'll also need to make sure you have installed a MongoDB instance on the local machine, with default settings.</p>
<p>Now CTRL-C the web server you started earlier and run <code>app.js</code> with </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">tim@Ethel:~/tutorial$ vertx run app.js
</pre>
<p>The persistor and web server should be running and it should serve the client application as before.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-connecting-up-the-client-side-to-the-event-bus">Step 4. Connecting up the client side to the Event Bus</h2><br/>
<p>So far we have a web server running, and a server side persistor listening on the event bus, but not doing anything.</p>
<p>We need to connect up the client side so it can interact with the persistor on the event bus.</p>
<p>To that we use a SockJS bridge.</p>
<p>SockJS is a technology which allows a full-duplex WebSocket-like connection between browsers and servers, even if the browser or network doesn't support websockets.</p>
<p>SockJS bridge is a server side vert.x component which uses SockJS to connect up the browser with the vert.x event bus on the server side.</p>
<p>SockJS and the SockJS bridge is explained in detail in the documentation, so we won't go into more detail here.</p>
<p>To create a SockJS bridge, we just create an instance of <code>vertx.SockJSBridge</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">new vertx.SockJSBridge(server, {prefix : '/eventbus'}, [] );
</pre>
<p>Edit <code>web_server.js</code> so it looks like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">load('vertx.js');

var server = new vertx.HttpServer();

// Link up the client side to the server side event bus
new vertx.SockJSBridge(server, {prefix : '/eventbus'}, [] );

server.requestHandler(function(req) {
  if (req.path === '/') {
    req.response.sendFile('web/index.html');
  } else if (req.path.indexOf('..') === -1) {
    req.response.sendFile('web' + req.path);
  } else {
    req.response.statusCode = 404;
    req.response.end;
  }
}).listen(8080, 'localhost');

function vertxStop() {
  server.close();
}
</pre>
<p>What we're doing here is creating an instance of a SockJS bridge and telling it that any requests it receives with the prefix <code>/eventbus</code> should be considered traffic for the event bus.</p>
<p>The original request handler for the static data is still there, and that will still be invoked for any requests that don't have the prefix <code>/eventbus</code> on their path.</p>
<p>There's one other thing we have to do here.</p>
<p>For security reasons, by default, the SockJS bridge will reject all event bus messages sent from the client side. After all, we don't want just anyone being able to delete everything in the database.</p>
<p>To allow messages through we have to tell the bridge what sort of messages we're going to allow through. This is done by specifying permitted matches, using the third parameter when creating the bridge.</p>
<p>Initially, we only want to allow through requests to the persistor to find albums. This will be used by the client side application to request the catalogue so it can display the list of available items to buy.</p>
<p>Edit the code in <code>web_server.js</code> so it looks like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">load('vertx.js');

var server = new vertx.HttpServer();

// Link up the client side to the server side event bus
new vertx.SockJSBridge(server, {prefix : '/eventbus'},
  [
    // Allow calls to get static album data from the persistor
    {
      address : 'demo.persistor',
      match : {
        action : 'find',
        collection : 'albums'
      }
    }
  ]
);

server.requestHandler(function(req) {
  if (req.path === '/') {
    req.response.sendFile('web/index.html');
  } else if (req.path.indexOf('..') === -1) {
    req.response.sendFile('web' + req.path);
  } else {
    req.response.statusCode = 404;
    req.response.end;
  }
}).listen(8080, 'localhost');

function vertxStop() {
  server.close();
}
</pre>
<p>The third parameter to the SockJSBridge constructor is an array of matches.  <br/>
</p>
<p>In our case, we're going to allow through any event bus messages from the client side to the address <code>demo.persistor</code> (which is where the persistor is listening), where the action field has the value <code>find</code>, and the <code>collection</code> field has the value <code>albums</code>.</p>
<p>Save the file.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-inserting-the-static-data">Step 5. Inserting the Static Data</h2><br/>
<p>We're almost at the point where the client side app can see the catalogue data. But first we need to insert some static data.</p>
<p>To do this we will create a script called <code>static_data.js</code> which just inserts catalogue and other data needed by the application in the database. It does this by sending JSON messages on the event bus.</p>
<p>Copy <code>static_data.js</code> into your directory as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">tim@Ethel:~/tutorial$ cp $VERTX_HOME/examples/demo/static_data.js .
</pre>
<p>We want to insert the static data only after the persistor verticle has completed starting up so we edit <code>app.js</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">vertx.deployWorkerVerticle('busmods/mongo_persistor.js', app_conf.persistor_conf, 1, function() {
  load('static_data.js');
});
</pre>
<p>The function that we're specifying in the call to <code>deployWorkerVerticle</code> will be invoked when the persistor is fully started. In that function we just load the static data script.</p>
<p>Save the edited <code>app.js</code> and restart it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">vertx run app.js
</pre>
<p>Refresh your browser.</p>
<p>You should now see the catalogue displayed in the client side app:</p>
<p><img alt="Client Application" src="tutorial_2.png"/><br/>
</p>
<p>Now there is some stuff to buy, you should be able to add stuff to your cart, and view the contents of your cart by clicking on the cart tab.</p>
<h2 id="step-6-requesting-data-from-the-server">Step 6. Requesting data from the server</h2><br/>
<p>As previously mentioned, this isn't a tutorial on how to write a knockout.js client-side application, but let's take a look at the code in the client side app that requests the catalogue data and populates the shop.</p>
<p>The client side application JavaScript is contained in the file <code>web/js/client_app.js</code>. If you open this in your text editor you will see the following line, towards the top of the script:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">var eb = new vertx.EventBus('http://localhost:8080/eventbus');
</pre>
<p>This is using the <code>vertxbus.js</code> library to create an <code>EventBus</code> object. This object is then used to send and receive messages from the event bus.</p>
<p>If you look a little further down the script, you will find the part which loads the catalogue data from the server and renders it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">eb.onopen = function() {

    // Get the static data

    eb.send('demo.persistor', {action: 'find', collection: 'albums', matcher: {} },
      function(reply) {
        if (reply.status === 'ok') {
          var albumArray = [];
          for (var i = 0; i &lt; reply.results.length; i++) {
            albumArray[i] = new Album(reply.results[i]);
          }
          that.albums = ko.observableArray(albumArray);
          ko.applyBindings(that);
        } else {
          console.error('Failed to retrieve albums: ' + reply.message);
        }
      });
  };
</pre>
<p>}; </p>
<p>The <code>onopen</code> is called when, unsurprisingly, the event bus connection is fully setup and open.<br/>
</p>
<p>At that point we are calling the <code>send</code> function on the event bus to a send a JSON message to the address <code>demo.persistor</code>. This is the address of the MongoDB persistor busmod that we configured earlier.</p>
<p>The JSON message that we're sending specifies that we want to find and return all albums in the database. (For a full description of the operations that the MongoDBPersistor busmod expects you can consult the busmods manual).</p>
<p>The final argument that we pass to to <code>send</code> is a reply handler. This is a function that gets called when the persistor has processed the operation and sent the reply back here. The first argument to the reply handler is the reply itself.</p>
<p>In this case, the reply contains a JSON message with a field <code>results</code> which contains a JSON array containing the albums.</p>
<p>Once we get the albums we give them to knockout.js to render on the view.</p>
<h2 id="step-7-handling-login">Step 7. Handling Login</h2><br/>
<p>In order to actually send an order, you need to be logged in so we know who has placed the order.</p>
<p>Vert.x ships with an out of the box busmod called <code>auth_mgr.js</code>. This is a very simple authentication manager which sits on the event bus and provides a couple of services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Login. This receives a username and password, validates it in the database, and if it is ok, a session is created and the session id sent back in the reply message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validate. This validates a session id, returning whether it is valid or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed information on this component please consult the busmods manual.</p>
<p>We're going to add an authentication manager component to our application so the user can login.</p>
<p>Open up app.js again, and add the following line:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">vertx.deployVerticle('busmods/auth_mgr.js', app_conf.auth_mgr_conf);
</pre>
<p>Also add the following to the <code>app_conf</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">auth_mgr_conf: {
    address: 'demo.authMgr',
    user_collection: 'users',
    persistor_address: 'demo.persistor'
  }
</pre>
<p>So, app.js should now look like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">load('vertx.js');

var log = vertx.getLogger();

// Our application config

var app_conf = {  
  persistor_conf: {
    address: 'demo.persistor',
    db_name: 'test_db'
  },
  auth_mgr_conf: {
    address: 'demo.authMgr',
    user_collection: 'users',
    persistor_address: 'demo.persistor'
  }
}

// Deploy the busmods

vertx.deployWorkerVerticle('busmods/mongo_persistor.js', app_conf.persistor_conf, 1, function() {
  load('static_data.js');
});

vertx.deployVerticle('busmods/auth_mgr.js', app_conf.auth_mgr_conf);

// Start the web server

vertx.deployVerticle('web_server.js');
</pre>
<p>We also need to tell the SockJS bridge to expect login messages coming onto the event bus.</p>
<p>Edit <code>web_server.js</code> and add the following match to the array of matches passed into the SockJSBridge constructor:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">// Allow user to login
{
  address : 'demo.authMgr.login'
}
</pre>
<p>So the line that constructs the SockJSBridge looks like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">new vertx.SockJSBridge(server, {prefix : '/eventbus'},
  [
    // Allow calls to get static album data from the persistor
    {
      address : 'demo.persistor',
      match : {
        action : 'find',
        collection : 'albums'
      }
    },
    // Allow user to login
    {
      address : 'demo.authMgr.login'
    }
  ]
);
</pre>
<p>Now restart the application</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">vertx run app.js
</pre>
<p>And refresh your browser.</p>
<p>Attempt to log-in with username <code>tim</code> and password <code>password</code>. A message should appear on the left telling you you are logged in!.</p>
<p><img alt="Client Application" src="tutorial_3.png"/></p>
<p>Let's take a look at the client side code which does the login.</p>
<p>Open <code>web/js/client_app.js</code> and scroll down to the <code>login</code> function. This gets trigged by knockout when the login button is pressed on the page.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">eb.send('demo.authMgr.login', {username: that.username(), password: that.password()}, function (reply) {
    if (reply.status === 'ok') {
      that.sessionID(reply.sessionID);
    } else {
      alert('invalid login');
    }
  });
</pre>
<p>As you can see, it sends a login JSON message to the authentication manager busmod with the username and password.</p>
<p>When the reply comes back with status <code>ok</code>, it stores the session id which causes knockout to display the "Logged in as... " message.</p>
<p>It's as easy as that.</p>
<h2 id="step-8-processing-orders">Step 8. Processing Orders</h2><br/>
<p>The next part to implement is submitting of orders.</p>
<p>One naive way to do this would be to directly insert the order in the database by sending a messager to the MongoDB persistor, then sending another message to the mailer to send an order confirmation email.</p>
<p>Problem is we don't want to just anyone inserting data into the database or sending emails from the client side (we don't want to become a spam relay!).</p>
<p>A better solution is to write a simple order manager verticle which sits on the event bus on the server and handles the whole order processing for us.</p>
<p>As orders arrive we want to</p>
<ol>
<li>Validate the user is logged in</li>
<li>If Ok, then persist the order in the database</li>
<li>If Ok, then send an order confirmation</li>
<li>Send back a confirmation to the client side.</li>
</ol>
<p>Copy the following into your editor and save it as <code>order_mgr.js</code> in your tutorial top-level directory.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">load('vertx.js');

var eb = vertx.EventBus;
var log = vertx.getLogger();

var handler = function(order, replier) {
  log.info('Received order in order manager ' + JSON.stringify(order));
  var sessionID = order.sessionID;
  eb.send('demo.authMgr.validate', { sessionID: sessionID }, function(reply) {
    if (reply.status === 'ok') {
      // Get the email address for the order
      var username = reply.username;
      eb.send('demo.persistor', {action:'findone', collection:'users', matcher: {username: username}},
        function(reply) {
          if (reply.status === 'ok') {
            replier({status: 'ok'});
          } else {
            log.warn('Failed to persist order');
          }
        });
    } else {
      // Invalid session id
      log.warn('invalid session id');
    }
  });
}

var address = "demo.orderMgr";
eb.registerHandler(address, handler);

function vertxStop() {
  eb.unregisterHandler(address, handler);
}
</pre>
<p>The order manager verticle registers a handler on the address <code>demo.orderMgr</code>. When an order message arrives in the handler the first thing it does is log out the order, then it sends another message to the authentication manager to validate if the user is logged in, given their session id (which is passed in the order message).</p>
<p>If the user was logged in ok, the order is persisted using the MongoDB persistor. If that returns ok, we send back a message to the client </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">if (reply.status === 'ok') {
    replier({status: 'ok'});
}
</pre>
<p>All message handlers when invoked receive a second argument. This is a replier function which can be invoked to send back a reply to the sender of the message. In other words, it's an implementation of the <em>request-response</em> pattern.</p>
<p>We'll also need to add another accepted match on the SockJSBridge config in <code>web_server.js</code> to tell it to let through orders:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">// Let through orders posted to the order manager
{
  address : 'demo.orderMgr'
}
</pre>
<p>So, it should look like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">new vertx.SockJSBridge(server, {prefix : '/eventbus'},
  [
    // Allow calls to get static album data from the persistor
    {
      address : 'demo.persistor',
      match : {
        action : 'find',
        collection : 'albums'
      }
    },
    // Allow user to login
    {
      address : 'demo.authMgr.login'
    },
    // Let through orders posted to the order manager
    {
      address : 'demo.orderMgr'
    }
  ]
);
</pre>
<p>Ok, let's take a look at the client side code which sends the order.</p>
<p>Open up <code>web/js/client_app.js</code> again, and look for the function <code>submitOrder</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">that.submitOrder = function() {

    if (!orderReady()) {
      return;
    }

    var orderJson = ko.toJS(that.items);
    var order = {
      sessionID: that.sessionID(),
      items: orderJson
    }

    eb.send('demo.orderMgr', order, function(reply) {
      if (reply.status === 'ok') {
        that.orderSubmitted(true);
        // Timeout the order confirmation box after 2 seconds
        window.setTimeout(function() { that.orderSubmitted(false); }, 2000);
      } else {
        console.error('Failed to accept order');
      }
    });
  }; 
};
</pre>
<p>This function simply converts the order into a JSON object, then calls <code>send</code> on the event bus to send it to the order manager verticle that we registered on address <code>demo.orderMgr</code>.</p>
<p>When the reply comes back we tell knockout to display a message.</p>
<p>Everything should be in order, so restart the app again:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">vertx run app.js
</pre>
<p>Refresh the browser.</p>
<p>Now log-in and add a few items into your cart. Click to the cart tab and click "Submit Order". The message "Your order has been accepted, an email will be on your way to you shortly".</p>
<p>Take a look in the console window of the application. You should see the order has been logged.</p>
<p><img alt="Client Application" src="tutorial_4.png"/></p>
<p><strong> Congratulations! You have just placed an order. </strong></p>
<h2 id="step-9-sending-emails">Step 9. Sending emails</h2><br/>
<p>We can easily send order confirmation emails from the order manager.</p>
<p>First we need to start a Mailer busmod. This is an out of the box busmod that comes bundled with vert.x</p>
<p>Add the following line to <code>app.js</code>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">vertx.deployWorkerVerticle('busmods/mailer.js', app_conf.mailer_conf);
</pre>
<p>And augment the app config with</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">mailer_conf: {
    address: 'demo.mailer'    
}
</pre>
<p>So it reads:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">var app_conf = {  
  persistor_conf: {
    address: 'demo.persistor',
    db_name: 'test_db'
  },
  auth_mgr_conf: {
    address: 'demo.authMgr',
    user_collection: 'users',
    persistor_address: 'demo.persistor'
  },
  mailer_conf: {
    address: 'demo.mailer'    
  }  
}
</pre>
<p>By default, the mailer attempts to send mails to a local mail server (e.g. sendmail daemon) running on <code>localhost</code>, port <code>25</code>. If you don't have such a daemon, you can try it out with (for example), a gmail account by changing the mailer config as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">mailer_conf: {
    address: 'demo.mailer',
    host: 'smtp.googlemail.com',
    port: 465,
    ssl: true,
    auth: true,
    username: 'username',
    password: 'password'    
}
</pre>
<p>(Obviously, changing the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> values).<br/>
</p>
<p>By default the email address of the <code>tim</code> user is <code>tim@localhost.com</code>. Updated this in <code>static-data.js</code> (and restart), and you should see the email being sent to the correct address.<br/>
</p>
<p>Next, we can edit <code>order_mgr.js</code> to actually send the email. We'll add the following function:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">function sendEmail(email, items) {

  var body = 'Thank you for your order\n\nYou bought:\n\n';
  var totPrice = 0.0;
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; items.length; i++) {
    var quant = items[i].quantity;
    var album = items[i].album;
    var linePrice = quant * album.price;
    totPrice += linePrice;
    body = body.concat(quant, ' of ', album.title, ' at $' ,album.price.toFixed(2),
                       ' Line Total: $', linePrice.toFixed(2), '\n');
  }
  body = body.concat('\n', 'Total: $', totPrice.toFixed(2));

  var msg = {
    from: 'vToons@localhost',
    to: email,
    subject: 'Thank you for your order',
    body: body
  };

  eb.send('demo.mailer', msg);
}
</pre>
<p>And insert a call the <code>sendEmail</code> function, just after the order has been persisted ok, so it looks like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">if (reply.status === 'ok') {
    replier({status: 'ok'});

    // Send an email            
    sendEmail(reply.result.email, order.items);

} else {
  log.warn('Failed to persist order');
}
</pre>
<h2 id="step-10-securing-the-connection">Step 10. Securing the Connection</h2><br/>
<p>So far in this tutorial, all client-server traffic has been over an unsecured HTTP or WebSockets connection. That's not a very good idea since we've been sending login credentials and orders.</p>
<p>Configuring vert.x to use secure sockets is very easy. (For detailed information on configuring HTTPS, please
see the manual).</p>
<p>Edit <code>web_server.js</code> again, and edit the line that creates the HTTP server so it reads:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">var server = new vertx.HttpServer()
    .setSSL(true)
    .setKeyStorePath('my-keystore.jks')
    .setKeyStorePassword('password');
</pre>
<p>Copy the keystore from the distribution</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">tim@Ethel:~/tutorial$ cp $VERTX_HOME/examples/demo/server-keystore.jks .
</pre>
<p><em>The keystore is just a Java keystore which contains the certificate for the server. It can be manipulated using the Java <code>keytool</code> command.</em>         <br/>
</p>
<p>You'll also need to edit <code>web/js/client_app.js</code> so the line which creates the client side event bus instance now uses <code>https</code> as the protocol:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">var eb = new vertx.EventBus('https://localhost:8080/eventbus');
</pre>
<p>Now restart the app again.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">vertx run app.js
</pre>
<p>And go to your browser. This time point your browser at <code>https://localhost:8080</code>. <em>Note it is <strong>https</strong> not http</em>.</p>
<p><em>You'll initially get a warning from your browser saying the server certificate is unknown. This is to be expected since we haven't told the browser to trust it. You can ignore that for now. On a real server your server cert would probably be from a trusted certificate authority.</em></p>
<p>Now login, and place an order as before.</p>
<p>Easy peasy. <strong>It just works</strong></p>
<h2 id="step-11-scaling-the-application">Step 11. Scaling the application</h2><br/>
<h3 id="scaling-the-web-server">Scaling the web server</h3><br/>
<p>Scaling up the web server part is trivial. Simply start up more instances of the webserver. You can do this by changing the line that starts the verticle <code>web_server.js</code> to something like:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">// Start 32 instances of the web server!

vertx.deployVerticle('web_server.js', null, 32);
</pre>
<p>(<em>Vert.x is clever here, it notices that you are trying to start multiple servers on the same host and port, and internally it maintains a single listening server, but round robins connections between the various instances</em>.)</p>
<h3 id="scaling-the-processing">Scaling the processing.</h3><br/>
<p>In our trivial example it probably won't make much difference, but if you have some fairly intensive processing that needs to be done on the orders, it might make sense to maintain a farm of order processors, and as orders come into the order manager, to farm them out to one of the available processors.</p>
<p>You can then spread the processing load not just between multiple processors on the same machine, but between many processors on different machines of the network.</p>
<p>Doing this is easy with vert.x. Vert.x ships with an out-of-the-box busmod called <code>WorkQueue</code> which allows you to easily create queues of work can be shared out amongst many processors.</p>
<p>Please consult the busmods manual for more information on this.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
<p>This tutorial gives you just a taste of the kinds of things you can do with vert.x. </p>
<p>With just a few lines of code you can create real, scalable web-enabled applications.</p>
<p>With a network of verticles communicating on an event bus which spans multiple machines on both the server side and client side JavaScript, the only limit is your imagination.</p></div>
